## What is MONO

Mono is a platform for developing and running cross-platform applications . It is a free and open-source implementation of Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework.
Thus, It  doesn't not need to have windows system to use this package. I was able to run on it my mac and was able to verify linux environment as well. 

### If you are not able to Download the folder due to exe file content uder linux then:

* Download xgbfi_txt.zip package

where I changed the content of the package XgbFeatureInteractions.exe  to  XgbFeatureInteractions.txt
re-zipped the content, which you can change the extension to exe before using it. Hopefully this will help you download the package without any issue. 

* download the zip file (xgbfi_txt.zip)
* then run ```unzip xgbfi_txt.zip && cd xgbfi```
* run ```mv XgbFeatureInteractions.txt  XgbFeatureInteractions.exe```
* run ```mono XgbFeatureInteractions.exe```
* run ```python xgbfi_from_zip.py``
